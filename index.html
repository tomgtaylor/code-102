            <p>The word 'physics' comes from the Greek 'knowledge of nature,' and in general, the field aims to analyze and understand the natural phenomena of the universe. One thing that may come to mind when you think of physics is the many scientific laws, which are statements describing phenomena that have been repeatedly tested and confirmed. This is actually an important part of physics. Physicists perform and repeat experiments, sometimes ad nauseam, to formulate these laws and explain how our universe works. These laws (such as gravity and Newton's laws of motion) are so thoroughly tested that they are accepted as 'truths,' and they can be used to help us predict how other things will behave.</p>

                <p>Chemistry is the study of matter, defined as anything that has mass and takes up space, and the changes that matter can undergo when it is subject to different environments and conditions. Chemistry seeks to understand not only the properties of matter, like the mass or composition of a chemical element, but also how and why matter undergoes certain changes â€” whether something transformed because it combined with another substance, froze because it was left for two weeks in a freezer, or changed colors because it was exposed to too much sunlight.</p>
